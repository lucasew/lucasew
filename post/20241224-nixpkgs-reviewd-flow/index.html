(and I expect memes incoming about this) for over 4 years,
<a href=https://github.com/lucasew/nixcfg/commit/10ed3d3c9ed02b97bb0d82545499a9fc51a39e63 target=_blank rel=external>2020-07-37 to be exact</a>,
and eventually in the Nix world you will need to engage in nixpkgs somehow.</p><p>I have over 100 PRs there, some of them adding modules,
some of them adding packages, some maintaining packages
and some failed experiments (<a href=https://github.com/lucasew/nixcfg/blob/b754398dd6e699c5bedbf0317e9661894a5f85ec/nix/nodes/bootstrap/port-alloc.nix target=_blank rel=external>that some of them I don&rsquo;t consider exactly failed</a>).</p><p>One struggle I had with reviewing PRs is being a bit too superficial, like I can&rsquo;t test stuff properly.
Having whiterun now (Ryzen 5600G) helped a lot building tests because riverwood (i5 7200U) is a little too slow for builds.</p><p>From a few months to now we (the NixOS Brazil group) experimented with implementations of GitHub Actions workflows to build
stuff for us. Most of the work came from me and <a href=https://github.com/thiagokokada target=_blank rel=external>thiagokokada</a>. We first wanted a way to clean up
space from the GitHub Actions runtime. This is <a href=https://github.com/thiagokokada/free-disk-space target=_blank rel=external>his implementation</a> and
this is <a href=https://github.com/lucasew/action-i-only-care-about-nix/ target=_blank rel=external>my implementation</a>. My implementation is much more aggressive
and ignorant working on files themselves because, as the name says, I only care about Nix. If it&rsquo;s not strictly essential for
the workflow runtime I am deleting it. He may have tweaked it more since I visit the last time tho.</p><p>About the automatic review system, I had built, at first, a workflow that runs in my
<a href=https://github.com/lucasew/nixcfg/blob/master/.github/workflows/nixpkgs-review.yml target=_blank rel=external>dotfiles repository</a>,
and he <a href=https://github.com/thiagokokada/nixpkgs/blob/fork/actions/nixpkgs-review.nix target=_blank rel=external>committed to his nixpkgs fork</a>.
Different approaches, basically the same results.</p><p>There is nothing stolen in either repo. It&rsquo;s all public property :)</p><p>Then he <a href=https://t.me/nixosbrasilofftopic/118034 target=_blank rel=external>commented this</a>.</p><p>I was just entered end of year collective vacations (this is a thing here at $WORK) and I was kinda bored looking
for a side project when at home.</p><p>Seemed like a perfect fit.</p><p>At first their idea was to write a cronjob that would <code>getUpdates</code> Telegram then react to messages, then I told them about Cloudflare Workers.</p><p>I did some stuff with Cloudflare Workers already, and I loved how fast and responsive things are. No cold starts. At the end of the day
it&rsquo;s all a JS bundle. Would be fun. This was in 2024-12-19.</p><blockquote><p>Luc√£o √© uma m√°quina de falar coisa aleat√≥ria e implementa√ß√£o duvidosa :P
(translation: Luc√£o is a random talk and doubtful implementation machine :P)
~thiagokokada, 2024 - <a href=https://t.me/nixosbrasilofftopic/118049 target=_blank rel=external>Link</a></p></blockquote><p>He is not wrong.</p><p>I was defending my idea like a good father of ideas would do, showing the concerns, how the technology deals with common problems in the scope.</p><p>And I was alone because I was basically the only one that did know about this technology, and that&rsquo;s when
<a href=https://github.com/nixosbrasil/nixpkgs-reviewd target=_blank rel=external>nixpkgs-reviewd</a> was born.</p><p>Most of the work happened in two days. Basically the challenge was the following:</p><ul><li>A route handler that would treat webhooks from Telegram</li><li>That route handler would parse Telegram commands and react accordingly and if the command is well formed, it would trigger a GitHub Actions
workflow dispatch workflow with arguments from that command.</li><li>That workflow would trigger either one or three jobs that would run nixpkgs-review in each target I can setup. One == only linux.
Three == linux + darwin.</li><li>Each job would post the result independently.</li></ul><p>This approach had some issues, especially around spammy behavior. I needed to iterate on this because some people got angry about that,
and I am fine with it. It was a bit rude but, let&rsquo;s be honest, I deserved it.</p><p>After many iterations and bug fixes the current iteration only posts two comments. One to warn that the
workflow started, so the people on the PR can get real time information about the state of the build, and
another when everything is done, that would post a comment almost the same as the one <code>nixpkgs-review</code> itself would post.</p><p>Yeah, there were suggestions around using multi-target <code>nixpkgs-review</code> then setting up workflows as remote builders, but this
would cause some issues like:</p><ul><li>Remote builders have to have ssh authentication.</li><li>Remote builders would have to be running for as long as the slowest build is running.</li><li>To connect the builders, there would need to have some kind of overlay networking that is fast, so they can reach each other.</li><li>I can get a very close result with much less complexity involved.</li></ul><p>Also, while doing this I learned a GitHub Actions thing I really loved. You can add user-friendly summaries that appear when the workflow
finishes by writing it to <code>$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY</code>. This helped me to resolve the spammy behavior by bringing the details of a run in the summary
so if someone wants to know something about the run, the workflow link is there, so you only need to visit it.</p><p>How it helped me to achieve flow?</p><p>Nixpkgs has some patterns around the PR list.</p><ul><li>Most of them are <a href=https://github.com/r-ryantm target=_blank rel=external>r-ryantm</a> automated PRs, so I could only skip them unless they tag me for being a maintainer.</li><li>There are some first time contributors that bring more out of shape PRs that need some iterations until buildable state is achievable.</li><li>Other PRs may include manual bumps and <em>backports</em>, miscellaneous fixes, people adding update scripts to let the bot cook the next
updates and stuff like that, and refactoring.</li></ul><p>The flow came from the following:</p><ul><li>I search for PRs that are not created by <em>r-ryantm</em> and not stale: <code>is:open is:pr -author:r-ryantm -label:"2.status: stale"</code></li><li>Open a few in new tab. I only open PRs that already have the rebuild tags in there.</li><li>If it looks functionally good, I run the bot. If there is <em>darwin</em> rebuilds I also run the bot with the <code>+darwin</code> flag.</li><li>When the bot notifies me that the PR is ready I then look at the results, try to help debug the package and if it&rsquo;s alright I check
if stuff is in the right place, commit names OK and if everything seems mergeable I try to bring more people to look at it either by
adding the link to <a href=https://discourse.nixos.org/t/prs-ready-for-review/3032 target=_blank rel=external>&ldquo;PRs ready for review&rdquo;</a> or adding the reviewers manually.</li><li>I get an email for each round trip, and email is asynchronous communication, so I look when I am ready.</li></ul><p>Note that none of the steps requires me to wait, stay on the computer and react fast. I can put a dozen PRs to review then touch some grass.</p><p>I can do most of the work in my phone. Right now only pragmatic tests,
<a href=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/367491 target=_blank rel=external>like the one I did with chime</a>, require me to stay at the computer,
and those I can queue up and when I go to the computer those are basically all cached.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s it. By <em>dogfooding</em> a tool I created based on shoulders of giants I&rsquo;ve never reviewed so many <em>nixpkgs</em> PRs.</p><p>BTW Merry Christmas to you all, and I hope you have a 2025 as wonderful as 2024 was to me!</p></main></body>
