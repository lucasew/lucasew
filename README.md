- Working on R&D in Computer Vision, mostly on tooling and data crunching.
- I like to know why the things work the way they work and I don't trust nothing that I can't question about and get a satisfactory answer.
- I try to not optimize what shouldn't exist. Less is more. Isolate or eliminate chaos. I do consulting though.
- Always learning something. Sometimes I post about on Twitter, my [Telegram channel (pt_BR)](https://t.me/canaldolucao) and on my blog.
- Looking for short technical challenges, not political ones. Have one? Tell me more on lucas@lew.tec.br!
