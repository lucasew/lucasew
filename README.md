# My name is Lucas Eduardo Wendt

- I like to know why the things work the way they work and I don't trust nothing that I can't question about and get a satisfactory answer.
- Duolingo user since 2015 :owl:
- I like tools that work without a lot of manual {re,}configuration like Nix, AWK, Shell Script, AHK, Automate and Magisk.
- I also program in a few more *normal* languages, mostly Go and Typescript.
- Less is more
- Also I have a lot of practice about virus removal in Windows machines. I don't need this skills in a linux machine because linux don't get virus like Windows (almost everytime it's as easy as read the thing before clicking next)
- I blog sometimes at [blog-do-lucao](https://blog-do-lucao.vercel.app). Currenly (20/11/2020) there are only pt-BR posts
- Markdown is the best format to write, blog and share information
